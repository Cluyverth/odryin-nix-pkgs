## 🚀 How to Use

To install packages from this repository, you need to include it in your Nix configuration, typically as a NUR channel.

### Using with NUR (Recommended)

```nix
{ config, pkgs, ... }:

let
  # 1. Import the NUR tool
  nur = builtins.fetchTarball "https://github.com/nix-community/NUR/archive/master.tar.gz";

  # 2. Load the packages from Cluyverth's repository (nur-packages)
  cluyverthPkgs = import "${nur}/repos/cluyverth/nur-packages" { inherit pkgs; };

in
{
  # ... (rest of your configuration)

  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs // cluyverthPkgs; [
    # Your package is now available!
    helium
    # other packages...
  ];
}
```

### Alternative: Using as a Direct Overlay

```nix
nixpkgs.overlays = [
  (final: prev: {
    # Imports packages from this repository (username is cluyverth)
    cluyverth-pkgs = import (
      builtins.fetchTarball "https://github.com/cluyverth/nur-packages/archive/main.tar.gz"
    ) { pkgs = prev; };
    
    # Expose the Helium package directly
    helium = final.cluyverth-pkgs.helium;
  })
];
```
